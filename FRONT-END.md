# Front End (1.5 hrs)

We expect this portion of the take-home to require about 1.5 hours of focused time to complete. 

### Goals

- Test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Load state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently

### Pre-requisites

- Spotify account (free-tier)
- Spotify client ID & secret set in `config.js`

### Requirements

Please build pages with the following:

1. Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs. Use the API path `new-releases`.
2. Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*. use the API path `featured-playlists`.
3. Fetch and display *Browse Genres*. Use the api path `categories`.
4. (Optional; as time permits) Surprise us with something if you have the time. Your choice. Could even be a bit of writing about the task or description about something you might consider. Or even a recommendation for changes to our take home!
