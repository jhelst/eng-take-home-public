# Engineering Take Home Test

## Introduction

Welcome and thank you for taking the time to complete our engineering take home!

There are two sections to this take home with time estimates. Please complete both and keep to the time allotted. If you do not complete a section, add annotations for what you would do if you had had more time. Or if you are unable to complete a section, give us a natural language version of how you would approach the problem. Note that the time limit is mostly out of respect for your time; and you get points for clarity of approach and ability to communicate your problem-solving strategy.

The sections are as follows:

[Front End Coding Section](./FRONT-END.md) (1.5hrs)

In this section, we ask you to build out a "Spootify" site given some code but with bits left out.

[Writing Section](WRITING.md) (.5 hrs)

In this ection, we ask you to write about your technology background and preferences.
